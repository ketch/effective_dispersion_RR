*********************************************************************

Code to generate the figures in section Effective sound speed. 
** Run polar_plot/sound_speed.m to generate the polar plot. 
** Within 2D_wave/leading_order run solver.m and then plotting.m
   to generate some data and the plots for the 2D wave propagation 
   considering the leading order homogenized solution. 
** Within 2D_wave/FV_simulation run psystem.py to generate the data, 
   then run plots_to_paper.py to generate the plots. 
   Since running psystem.py is expensive, the required data to 
   generate the plots is included.
