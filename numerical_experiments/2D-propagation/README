Code to generate the 2D wave propagation figures in section wave 
     behavior in 2D layered periodic media. 
** There are three folders: FV_simulations, homogenized_solutions and 
   plotting_slices. 
** Within FV_simulation there are three folders each with subfolders. 
   For each subfolder run psystem.py and then plots_to_paper.py. This
   will generate the surface plots and .txt files with data of the FV
   slices. Copy all .txt files to the corresponding subfolder in 
   plotting_slices. 
** Within homogenized_solutions run solver.m six times uncommenting 
   each time just one set of parameters. This will generate six .mat
   files that have to be copied to the corresponding subfolders of 
   plotting_slices.
** Within each subfolder in plotting_slices run plotting_slices.m to 
   generate the slices plots. 
NOTE: Each time psystem.py has to be run we include the required data 
      to generate the plots.
