The code in these subdirectories creates the plots of slices along the x- and y-axes that
appear on the right side of many of the 2D simulation results in the paper.  Before running
the plotting code, you must run the homogenized simulations by uncommenting the appropriate
line for each simulation in `numerical_experiments/2D-propagation/homogenized_solutions/solver.m`
and copy the resulting .mat files to these subdirectories.
