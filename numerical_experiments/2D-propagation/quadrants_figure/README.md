This directory contains the data and code to reproduce the figure from the introduction
showing four different experiments.  The PyClaw FV runs were done on Shaheen; the input
and output files are in the subdirectories.  The .mat files in this directory were generated
by running the homogenized solution in MATLAB and extracting just the data necessary for the
plots.
